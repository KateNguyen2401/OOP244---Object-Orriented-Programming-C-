1. The copy assignment checks self-assignment first because if the object is assigned to itself, the 
program results in unpredictable behavior. Since more than one pointer or reference can point to the
same object.
2. In copy constructor and copy assignment, to avoid duplication, I use the code *this = source;in
the copy constructor since both have the same codes
3. I have learned to use resourse instance pointer and it afects to the dynamic memory, I also learnt
the meaning and purpose of copy constructor and copy assignment and the differences between shallow 
and deep copy.

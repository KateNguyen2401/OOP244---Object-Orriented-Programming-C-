1. It got the error when i tried to put the templated functions in Data.cpp. If
I move  all the templated functions to Data.h, it works well.
2. It works if we define the templates function above the main()
3. Yes, I can. The advantage of using templates is that we can avoid duplicating
code and overloading functions.
4. There is no difference. The use of class and typename (in the context of a 
template parameter that refers to a type) is interchangeable.

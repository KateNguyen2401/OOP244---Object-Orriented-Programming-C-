Quiz reflection(mid-term):
Question 1:
b. #define ADD_RATE 2
It replaces ADD_RATE with 2 everywhere in the program
c. using namespace std;
It allows us to use the namespace std which is the C++ standard library
Question 4:
h.
#include <iostream>
#include "CashRegistor.h"
int main(){
	CashRegistor staticReg(1,1,1,1);
	CashRegistor* dynamicReg = nullptr;
	dynamicReg = new CashRegistor[2];
	dynamicReg->dispense(3,true);
	staticReg.dispense(4,false);
	staticReg += dynamicReg;
	std::cout << (staticReg == dynamicReg) ? "true" : "false";
	delete[] dynamicReg;
	return 0;
}
